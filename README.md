## Hello, 👋

I'm **Kwiffl** — an application engineer who aspires to develop apps that contribute to day-to-day life.

I mostly work with **Frontend development**, including **CSS**, **HTML**, and **TypeScript**, which I am currently further exploring.

This profile is for displaying current projects and small, sprouting ideas, including:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Elements  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Systems  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Complete Applications

## Information 📌

I mainly use **React Native** for developing and shipping applications on both **iOS** and **Android**
I also use **React.js** for building web applications

Whenever I get an idea for an application - There is a high chance I will build **systems, elements or sections instead** of a complete application for practice.

I have previous experience in Roblox Development:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Which utilizes the language **Luau** (A fork of Lua)
